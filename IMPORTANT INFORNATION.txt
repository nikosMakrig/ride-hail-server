Usefull information (a few words about the app)
The app has two main views
1) Simple survey
2) More complex survey for selected users

Also there is a button on the top left of the screen, 
this is for demo purposes only as it emulates the two diferrent surveys a user can receive.

Form builder
Since the servey can change often and anytime, i have created a form builder component in the client side.
This components gets feeded by a mock json, which can be easily replaced by a api call regarding the company's needs.
So with a backoffice tool , one can create a survey dynamic and then visualize that on the actual survey.

The actual data of the survey get saved as a json because they are dynamic and the number of columns could not be static.
